# Fix: Email Not Sending via Resend

## ✅ Problem Solved

The environment variables are **correctly set** in Render:
- ✅ `RESEND_API_KEY` = `re_RvKoP4WQ_GWCmmWA3NPJPyN8f4xQ2FTqU`
- ✅ `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` = `benoats@gmail.com`

## 🔧 Issue: Service Needs Restart

When you add environment variables to Render, the **running service doesn't automatically pick them up** until it restarts or redeploys.

## 🚀 Solution: Restart/Redeploy Service

### Option 1: Manual Restart (Fastest)
1. Go to Render Dashboard → `alttext-ai-backend`
2. Look for **"Restart"** or **"Manual Deploy"** button
3. Click it to restart the service
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for restart

### Option 2: Trigger New Deployment
1. Render Dashboard → `alttext-ai-backend`
2. Go to **"Deploys"** tab
3. Click **"Manual Deploy"** or **"Deploy latest commit"**
4. Wait for deployment to complete

### Option 3: Wait for Auto-Redeploy
- If Render is connected to your git repo
- It will auto-deploy when new code is pushed
- The diagnostic code I just added should deploy soon

## ✅ After Restart

Once the service restarts:
1. The environment variables will be loaded
2. Resend will start working
3. Check logs for: `✅ RESEND_API_KEY found, attempting to send email via Resend...`
4. Emails should send successfully!

## 🧪 Test After Restart

1. Request password reset again
2. Check your email inbox
3. Check Render logs for success message:
   - `✅ Password reset email sent via Resend to benoats@gmail.com`
   - `Email ID: [some-id]`

## 📝 Why This Happens

Node.js loads environment variables **only when the process starts**. Adding variables to Render doesn't affect running processes until they restart.

**Quick Fix:** Just restart the service in Render dashboard! 🚀
